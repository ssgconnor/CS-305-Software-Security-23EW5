Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

A consulting company called Artemis Financial is working to develop financial services that will allow customers to select the best individualized services for their needs. In order to guarantee that the information being communicated is secure, they are adding security via certain encryption methods.


What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I thoroughly tested the clients software and informed them of any vulnerabilities found so tactics could be developed to address said vulnerabilities. It is less expensive to incorporate security into development from the start than it is to fix security problems after the fact. By adhering to secure coding principles, you can decrease the risk of security vulnerabilities and save money on incident response, forensic investigation, legal fees, and possible fines that are related to security issues. By giving secure coding techniques first priority, you show that you are dedicated to safeguarding client data and maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information. This increases client confidence and establishes your business as one that values security.


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Intigrating the Maven plug-in was difficult initially. I did find creating certificates to be rather easy.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Implementing HTTP and creating secure certificates strengthened security. I would use automated security testing technologies, such as interactive application security testing (IAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and static analysis tools. These programs can scan your codebase, find potential security holes, and make mitigation suggestions.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

By running the project numerous times as well as performing dependency checks both before and after working on any code.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I utilized the keytool addon for Eclipse and found it to be quite useful. I would also implement dependency checks and vulnerability assessments in the future.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

My ability to interpret the clients needs as well as identifying any threats in a precise and informative manner followed by a range of security recommendations.
